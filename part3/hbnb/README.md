<h1>HBnB Project — Part 3:</h1>
<em>Enhanced Backend with Authentication and Database Integration</em>

</center>

## 📖 Project Overview

This repository contains Part 3 of the HBnB Project. In this phase, we significantly enhance the backend by introducing JWT authentication, role-based access control, and persistent database integration using SQLAlchemy with SQLite (for development) and preparation for MySQL (for production).

We’re transitioning from a prototype to a real-world backend architecture that is secure, scalable, and production-ready.

## 🚀 Objectives

By the end of this phase, we aim to:

+ Secure the API with JWT-based authentication (Flask-JWT-Extended),
+ Implement role-based access control, using is_admin flag on users,
+ Replace in-memory storage with SQLite + SQLAlchemy ORM,
+ Define and map database relationships between all entities,
+ Visualize the database schema,
+ Enforce data consistency and validation in models and routes.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

+ Python 3.x
+ Flask
+ Flask-RESTx
+ Flask-JWT-Extended
+ SQLAlchemy
+ SQLite
+ argon2 (for secure password hashing)
+ draw.io (for ER diagrams)
+ Pydantic

## 🧩 Key Features

+ JWT Authentication: Secure login/logout and token-based access to protected endpoints,
+ Role-Based Access Control: Admin vs. regular user permissions (e.g., only admins can create an amenity),
+ Persistent Storage: Switched from in-memory to SQLite + SQLAlchemy ORM for full persistence,
+ Entity Relationship Diagram: Design and visualize relational database schemas with draw.io,
+ Validation & Error Handling: Model-level and route-level data checks and exception handling.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

+ Implement secure login/auth flows using JWT tokens,
+ Enforce fine-grained permissions based on user roles,
+ Manage persistent data with SQLAlchemy ORM,
+ Design and visualize relational database schemas with draw.io,
+ Prepare backend architecture for deployment in real environments.

## 🛠 How to Run

1️⃣ Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Proser-V/holbertonschool-hbnb.git
cd holbertonschool-hbnb/part3/hbnb
```

2️⃣ Install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3️⃣ Run the application:

```bash
python3 -m run
```
(You must be in the hbnb folder)

4️⃣ Access Swagger UI:

[http://localhost:5001/](http://localhost:5001/)  
(We moved the port to 5001 as it was tested with a Mac and port 5000 is AirPlay on MacOS)

## 🧪 Testing

Run automatic tests:

While the server running:
+ Open a new terminal
+ ```cd tests/```
+ ```./run_tests.py```

Automatic tests are for place, user and amenity.

You can also test individual endpoints using Swagger UI, Postman, or cURL.
(Tested functional with SwaggerUI on web browser)

## 🚧 Roadmap

✅ Part 1: Project Design  
✅ Part 2: Business Logic and API Endpoints  
🟢 Part 3: Authentication and Database Integration (You are here)  
🔒 Part 4: Web Client (HTML + JS UI)
